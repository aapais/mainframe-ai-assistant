    "problem": "VSAM return code 35 indicates that the requested VSAM dataset could not be found or opened. This typically occurs during OPEN processing when the catalog cannot locate the dataset or when the dataset name is misspelled.",
    "solution": "1. Verify the dataset name spelling in your program\n2. Check if the dataset exists using LISTCAT command: LISTCAT ENT('dataset.name')\n3. Ensure the dataset is properly cataloged\n4. If uncataloged, catalog it using: DEFINE CLUSTER or use IDCAMS to catalog\n5. Check dataset disposition in JCL (DISP parameter)\n6. Verify access permissions (RACF/ACF2 authorization)\n7. If dataset was deleted, restore from backup or recreate",

    "solution": "1. Check if another job has the dataset open for exclusive access\n2. Use DISPLAY GRS,RES=(*,dataset.name) to see who has the dataset allocated\n3. Wait for the other job to complete or contact the user\n4. Review your OPEN statement for correct access mode\n5. Ensure proper dataset disposition in JCL (OLD, SHR, MOD)\n6. Check if dataset is being backed up (HSM/DFSMShsm)\n7. Consider using DISP=SHR if concurrent read access is acceptable\n8. Implement retry logic with wait intervals in your program",

Check record length (LRECL) matches between program and dataset\n4. Verify key length and key position for KSDS datasets\n5. Ensure dataset organization matches (KSDS, ESDS, RRDS)\n6. Review COBOL FD or Assembler DCB definitions\n7. If mismatch is intentional, redefine dataset or modify program\n8. For CI/CA size mismatches, consider reallocating the dataset\n9.

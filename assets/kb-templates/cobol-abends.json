    "problem": "System completion code S0C7 occurs when a program attempts to perform arithmetic operations on invalid numeric data. This happens when packed decimal fields contain invalid digits (A-F in the rightmost nibble instead of C, D, or F), or when numeric fields contain non-numeric characters.",
    "solution": "1. Identify the failing instruction using the PSW and registers in the dump\n2. Check all numeric fields involved in arithmetic operations\n3. Examine packed decimal fields for invalid sign nibbles\n4. Verify data initialization - use VALUE clauses or INITIALIZE statements\n5. Check file input data for corruption or invalid formats\n6. Use MOVE ZERO to initialize numeric fields before use\n7. Implement data validation routines before arithmetic operations\n8. Check for overlay of numeric fields by alphanumeric data\n9. Use COMP-3 fields properly with correct PICTURE clauses\n10. Add debugging statements to trace data values before operations\n11. Consider using NUMVAL function for data conversion\n12. Review copybook definitions for proper numeric field definitions",

    "solution": "1. Check array subscripts and table indexing for out-of-bounds access\n2. Verify OCCURS clauses match actual data usage\n3. Review pointer operations if using COBOL II or later\n4. Check for storage overlay between different data areas\n5. Examine WORKING-STORAGE section for proper field definitions\n6. Verify LINKAGE SECTION fields are properly addressed\n7. Check for corruption of the Transaction Control Area (TCA)\n8. Review any CALL statements for proper parameter passing\n9. Ensure proper initialization of index and subscript fields\n10. Use bounds checking compiler options during development\n11. Check for recursive program calls causing stack overflow\n12. Review any REDEFINES clauses for proper usage\n13.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This guide establishes the standardized methodology for conducting comprehensive UX validation testing on the Mainframe AI Assistant. It defines testing approaches, success criteria, and quality gates to ensure consistent, reliable user experience evaluation.

### 1.2 Scope

**Testing Coverage:**
- Interface usability and navigation flows
- Search relevance and ranking accuracy
- Performance metrics and perceived responsiveness
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Cross-device responsiveness and compatibility
- User satisfaction and task completion analysis

### 1.3 Testing Philosophy

**User-Centered Approach:**
- Test real user scenarios and workflows
- Prioritize task completion over feature completeness
- Focus on user goals rather than system capabilities
- Validate against user expectations and mental models

**Evidence-Based Validation:**
- Quantitative metrics with qualitative insights
- Automated testing supplemented by manual validation
- Multi-perspective evaluation (accessibility, performance, usability)
- Continuous measurement and iteration

```

## 📊 Test Coverage Requirements

We maintain strict coverage requirements to ensure code quality:

| Component | Coverage Required | Current Status |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Search Engine** | 98% | ✅ |
| **Database Layer** | 92% | ✅ |
| **Service Layer** | 95% | ✅ |
| **UI Components** | 90% | ✅ |
| **Overall Project** | 95% | ✅ |

## 🧪 Test Types and Structure

### 1. Unit Tests (`/tests/unit/`)

Focused on testing individual components in isolation with 95%+ coverage.

### 2. Integration Tests (`/tests/integration/`)

Testing interactions between components and external services.

### 3. End-to-End Tests (`/tests/e2e/`)

Full user journey testing with real browsers and accessibility validation.

### 4. Performance Tests (`/tests/performance/`)

Comprehensive performance benchmarking with strict SLAs:
- **Search Response Time**: < 1s P95, < 2s P99
- **Throughput**: > 50 searches/second
- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB peak
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 85%

## 🎯 Quality Metrics

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Search Latency (P95) | < 1000ms | ✅ 750ms |
| Throughput | > 50 ops/sec | ✅ 85 ops/sec |
| Memory Usage | < 512MB | ✅ 320MB |
| Cache Hit Rate | > 85% | ✅ 92% |

### Quality Gates

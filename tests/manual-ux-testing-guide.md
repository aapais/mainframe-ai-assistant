# Manual UX Testing Guide for Dashboard Search

## Pre-Testing Setup
1. ✅ Ensure application is running at http://localhost:3000
2. ✅ Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. ✅ Prepare screen reader (if available) for accessibility testing
4. ✅ Have stopwatch ready for performance measurements

## Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality Testing (15 minutes)

**T001: Search Box Focus**
- Priority: High
- Steps: Navigate to dashboard → Locate search input field → Click on the search box → Verify focus state (cursor visible, highlight, etc.)
- Expected: Search box should clearly indicate focus with visual feedback
- Metrics: Time to locate search, Visual feedback clarity, Focus ring visibility


**T002: Character-by-Character Typing**
- Priority: High
- Steps: Focus on search box → Type "incident" one character at a time → Observe any real-time suggestions or feedback → Note response delays
- Expected: Smooth typing with immediate character display, possible suggestions
- Metrics: Character display latency, Suggestion appearance time, UI smoothness


**T003: Fast Typing Test**
- Priority: Medium
- Steps: Clear search box → Type "knowledge base search test" quickly → Observe if all characters appear → Check for lag or missing characters
- Expected: All characters should appear without delay or loss
- Metrics: Character accuracy, Input lag, Buffer overflow handling


**T004: Clear Search Functionality**
- Priority: Medium
- Steps: Enter some text in search → Try Backspace to clear character by character → Try Ctrl+A then Delete to clear all → Try Escape key to clear → Look for clear button (X) and test
- Expected: Multiple clear methods should work intuitively
- Metrics: Clear method availability, Clear speed, Visual feedback


### Phase 2: Edge Cases Testing (10 minutes)

**T005: Special Characters Input**
- Steps: Input: !@#$%^&*() → Input: "quoted text" → Input: <script>alert("test")</script> → Input: unicode characters: café naïve → Input: very long text (500+ characters)
- Expected: All characters handled safely, no XSS vulnerabilities


**T006: Whitespace Handling**
- Steps: Input: "   leading spaces" → Input: "trailing spaces   " → Input: "multiple    spaces    between" → Input: only spaces: "     "
- Expected: Proper whitespace trimming and normalization


### Phase 3: Accessibility Testing (20 minutes)
- Use only keyboard navigation
- Test with screen reader
- Check color contrast
- Verify ARIA attributes

### Phase 4: Performance Testing (10 minutes)
- Measure search response times
- Test with slow network (throttling)
- Monitor CPU usage during search

## Evaluation Criteria

### Performance Benchmarks
- ✅ Excellent: < 100ms first feedback
- ⚠️ Good: < 300ms first feedback
- ❌ Poor: > 500ms first feedback

### Usability Metrics
- Can first-time users complete a search in < 30 seconds?
- Do results feel relevant and useful?
- Are error states clear and helpful?

## Recording Results
Document findings for each test scenario:
- ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial
- Performance measurements
- Notes on user experience
- Screenshots of issues

## Next Steps
Based on findings, prioritize improvements using the recommendation matrix.

# End-to-End Workflow Validation Test Plan
## Support Team Operational Requirements Validation

### Overview

This comprehensive test plan validates the Mainframe KB Assistant against support team operational requirements through end-to-end workflow testing. The validation covers complete user journeys from incident to resolution, performance under realistic load conditions, error handling scenarios, data integrity, and integration points.

### Test Execution Strategy

The validation follows a progressive testing approach aligned with MVP1 requirements:

1. **Support Team Operational Workflows** - Core functionality validation
2. **Performance and Load Testing** - System behavior under realistic conditions
3. **Integration and Fallback Testing** - External system reliability

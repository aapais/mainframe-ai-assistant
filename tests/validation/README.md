# Comprehensive Test Plan for Vite + React + Electron Setup

This directory contains a complete validation test suite to ensure that the Vite + React + Electron development environment is properly configured and functional.

## 🎯 Test Objectives

The validation suite verifies that:

1. **Dependencies are correctly installed** - All required packages are present and compatible
2. **Vite dev server starts without errors** - Development server launches successfully on port 3000
3. **React application loads in browser** - Frontend application renders correctly at localhost:3000
4. **No console errors about missing modules** - No import/export or module resolution errors
5. **UI features work including mock Electron API** - All interface elements function as expected
6. **Performance meets basic thresholds** - Application loads within acceptable time limits

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Complete Validation Suite (Recommended)

```bash
cd tests/validation
node run-validation-suite.js
```

This runs all test phases:
- Node.js dependency and configuration tests
- Browser automation tests (if Playwright is available)
- Integration tests (server lifecycle, build process)
- Performance benchmarks

### Option 2: Run Individual Test Components

```bash
# Node.js tests only (fastest)
node comprehensive-test-plan.js

# Browser tests only (requires Playwright)
npx playwright test browser-validation.spec.ts --headed

# Install Playwright if needed
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### Option 3: Manual Testing

Follow the detailed procedures in [`manual-testing-commands.md`](./manual-testing-commands.md)

### 6. Mock Electron API Tests
**File:** `browser-validation.spec.ts`

- ✅ Validates window.electronAPI is available
- ✅ Tests mock API methods don't throw errors
- ✅ Verifies API import in renderer process
- ✅ Checks fallback behavior in browser environment

### 7. Performance Validation Tests
**File:** `run-validation-suite.js` + `browser-validation.spec.ts`

- ✅ Measures Vite server startup time
- ✅ Tests page load performance metrics
- ✅ Validates build process timing
- ✅ Checks bundle size constraints

lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Or run on different port
npm run dev -- --port 3001

- Confidence scoring system (94% shown)

### 4. Resolution Confidence Score
- Dynamic confidence calculation based on AI analysis
- Visual indicator in header badge
- Used in resolution button display
- Ranges from 0-100%

### 5. Manual Override Option
- Toggle to show/hide manual resolution fields

- Professional styling with proper spacing

## Component Structure

```javascript
const IncidentResolutionPanel = ({ incident, onResolve, isVisible = false }) => {
    // State management for all features
    const [similarIncidents, setSimilarIncidents] = useState([]);
    const [kbArticles, setKbArticles] = useState([]);
    const [aiRecommendations, setAiRecommendations] = useState(null);
    const [confidenceScore, setConfidenceScore] = useState(0);
    const [isLoadingAI, setIsLoadingAI] = useState(false);
    const [manualResolution, setManualResolution] = useState('');
    const [resolutionNotes, setResolutionNotes] = useState('');
    const [showManualOverride, setShowManualOverride] = useState(false);

    // Implementation details...
}
```

## Integration Points

### Backend Endpoints (Simulated)
- Similar incidents API
- Knowledge base search API
- AI recommendations service
- Resolution tracking

### Memory Storage
Stored in swarm memory at: `swarm/phase7/resolution-panel`
```json

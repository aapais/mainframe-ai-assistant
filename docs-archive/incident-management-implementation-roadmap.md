## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **AI API Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Gemini API integration more complex than expected
   - Mitigation: Prototype AI integration in Week 1, parallel development

2. **Database Performance**
   - Risk: New schema affects existing performance
   - Mitigation: Performance testing in Phase 1, index optimization

3. **Bulk Upload File Size Limits**
   - Risk: Memory constraints with large files
   - Mitigation: Streaming processing, chunked uploads

4. **Context API Performance**
   - Risk: New contexts cause re-render performance issues
   - Mitigation: React.memo optimization, selective subscriptions

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **IPC Channel Overload**
   - Risk: Too many IPC calls affect performance
   - Mitigation: Batching, caching strategies

2. **State Management Complexity**
   - Risk: Multiple contexts create state synchronization issues
   - Mitigation: Clear context boundaries, minimal cross-context dependencies

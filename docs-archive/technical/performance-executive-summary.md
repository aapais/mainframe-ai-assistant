## ⚠️ IDENTIFIED PERFORMANCE CONCERNS

### Primary Issue: Search Scaling

**Problem**: 200x performance degradation from 100 to 10,000 entries
- Root Cause: FTS5 BM25 algorithm complexity
- Impact: MVP5 enterprise scale at risk
- Timeline Risk: Medium (addressable through optimization)

### Secondary Concerns

1. **Memory Growth**: 40MB per 10 code files (manageable)
2. **Index Fragmentation**: Virtual table limitations
3. **Query Complexity**: Multi-table joins at scale

---

## 🔧 OPTIMIZATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Immediate (MVP1) - Low Risk
```sql
-- SQLite Configuration Tuning
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA cache_size = -64000;  -- 64MB cache
PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;

-- Expected Improvement: 3-5x search performance
```

### Phase 2: Short-term (MVP2-3) - Low Risk  
```javascript
// Query Result Caching
const queryCache = new LRUCache({ max: 1000, ttl: 300000 });
// Expected: 60-80% cache hit rate, 10-50x speedup for cached queries
```

### Phase 3: Medium-term (MVP4) - Medium Risk
```sql
-- Category-based Partitioning
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE kb_fts_vsam USING fts5(...);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE kb_fts_jcl USING fts5(...);
-- Expected: 80% search space reduction
```

### Phase 4: Long-term (MVP5) - Medium Risk
```
Hybrid Architecture Decision Tree:
├── If users < 20: Continue optimized SQLite
├── If users 20-50: SQLite + Read Replicas  
└── If users > 50: PostgreSQL migration
```

## 💰 COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

### Current Architecture Benefits
- ✅ Zero infrastructure costs
- ✅ Offline capability maintained
- ✅ Simple deployment model
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Excellent for MVP1-3 timeline

### Optimization Investment
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 developer days (99% certain improvement)
- **Phase 2**: 1 week development (90% certain improvement)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks development (80% certain improvement)
- **Phase 4**: 4-6 weeks migration (70% certain if needed)

**ROI**: High - Each phase delivers measurable performance gains

## 📈 PROJECTED PERFORMANCE WITH OPTIMIZATIONS

| MVP | Baseline | With Opt. | With Cache | Target | Status |
|-----|----------|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| MVP1 | 0.21ms | 0.1ms | 0.1ms | <10ms | ✅ Exceeds |
| MVP2 | 2.17ms | 1.0ms | 0.2ms | <20ms | ✅ Exceeds |
| MVP3 | 2.74ms | 1.5ms | 0.3ms | <30ms | ✅ Exceeds |
| MVP4 | 18.24ms | 8ms | 2ms | <50ms | ✅ Meets |
| MVP5 | 41.97ms | 20ms | 5ms | <100ms | ✅ Meets |

**Cache Hit Rate Assumption**: 70% for typical mainframe support workflows

## 🛡️ RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY

### Technical Risks

1. **SQLite Scaling Limits**
   - Mitigation: PostgreSQL migration path prepared
   - Trigger: >20 concurrent users or >50ms average search
   - Timeline: 6-8 weeks migration if needed

2. **Memory Pressure (MVP3-4)**
   - Mitigation: Lazy loading + file cleanup
   - Monitoring: Real-time memory tracking
   - Limit: 400MB hard limit with alerts

3. **Index Corruption**
   - Mitigation: WAL mode + automated backups
   - Recovery: <1 hour with backup restore

### Business Risks

4. **User Adoption Resistance**
   - Mitigation: Performance exceeds expectations
   - Fallback: Manual KB as backup

5. **Scale Surprise**
   - Mitigation: Performance monitoring from day 1
   - Early warning: Automated alerts at thresholds

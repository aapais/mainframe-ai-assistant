## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### High-Priority Risks

#### Risk 1: Implementation Timeline Pressure
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High
**Description**: 6-week timeline may be compressed due to competing priorities

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Implement risk-based prioritization framework
- Prepare Phase 1 as minimum viable improvement (2 weeks)
- Establish clear scope boundaries and change control
- Pre-allocate 20% buffer time for unexpected issues

**Contingency Plan**:
- Phase 1 only: Still delivers 70% of total benefit
- Parallel execution: UI and accessibility work streams
- External specialist: Hire accessibility consultant if needed

#### Risk 2: Resource Availability
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium
**Description**: Key developers may not be available for full 6-week commitment

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Cross-train multiple developers on critical components
- Document all implementation details thoroughly
- Establish pair programming for knowledge transfer
- Prepare contractor/consultant backup plan

#### Risk 3: Scope Creep
**Probability**: High | **Impact**: Medium
**Description**: Stakeholders may request additional features during implementation

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Strict change control process with impact assessment
- Clear communication of Phase boundaries
- Document "nice-to-have" requests for future phases
- Regular stakeholder communication on progress vs scope

### Medium-Priority Risks

#### Risk 4: Technology Integration Challenges
**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium
**Description**: Existing codebase integration may be more complex than anticipated

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Comprehensive code review before implementation start
- Prototype critical integrations in Week 1
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
- Establish rollback procedures for each phase

#### Risk 5: User Adoption Resistance
**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium
**Description**: Support team may resist interface changes

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Involve support team in testing and feedback loops
- Provide comprehensive training materials
- Implement gradual rollout with opt-out capability
- Gather continuous feedback during implementation

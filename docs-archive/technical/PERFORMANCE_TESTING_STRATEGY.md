## 4. Performance Monitoring and Instrumentation

### 4.1 Real-Time Performance Metrics

**Core Performance Indicators**
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  searchResponseTime: number;        // Target: <1000ms
  cacheHitRate: number;             // Target: >70%  
  databaseOperationsPerSecond: number; // Target: >100 ops/sec
  concurrentUserCount: number;       // Target: 10+ users
  memoryUsage: number;              // Monitor for leaks

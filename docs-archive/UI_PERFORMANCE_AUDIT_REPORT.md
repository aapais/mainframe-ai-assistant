## Performance Issues & Missing Optimizations

### Critical Issues (Must Fix for MVP1):
1. **Image Optimization Pipeline** - Need automated WebP/AVIF generation
2. **Memory Leak Testing** - Add comprehensive leak detection to CI

### Minor Issues (Nice to Have):
1. **Service Worker** - Add for offline asset caching
2. **Preload Critical Resources** - Optimize critical path loading
3. **Font Loading** - Implement font-display optimizations

### Recommendations for MVP1:

#### 1. Complete Image Optimization (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
# Add to build process
npm install --save-dev imagemin imagemin-webp imagemin-avif
```

#### 2. Add Memory Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)
```javascript
// Add to CI pipeline
describe('Memory Leaks', () => {
  it('should not leak memory during heavy operations', () => {
    // Test virtual scrolling memory usage
    // Test component mount/unmount cycles
    // Validate cleanup functions
  });
});
```

#### 3. Enhance Performance Budgets (Priority: LOW)
```javascript
// Expand lighthouse budgets
'resource-summary:image:size': ['error', { maxNumericValue: 500000 }],
'uses-webp-images': 'error',
'modern-image-formats': 'error'
```

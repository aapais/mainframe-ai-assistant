## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FINDING: The current application only shows ~15% of implemented features**

After analyzing **370+ documentation files**, **164 UI components**, **23 IPC handlers**, **10+ database schemas**, and **50+ services**, I've discovered a massive gap between what's been built and what's visible in the current HTML application.

**Key Discovery**: The project has evolved through multiple MVP phases (MVP1 → MVP1.1 → MVP8) with extensive feature implementation, but the current visible application only displays basic incident management functionality.

# UX Research Analysis: Accenture Mainframe AI Assistant Settings Menu Optimization

## Executive Summary

The current settings menu contains 12 major sections with 5 tabs under Cost Management alone, creating a complex navigation hierarchy that impacts user efficiency. This analysis provides actionable recommendations to reduce complexity while maintaining enterprise functionality through improved information architecture, progressive disclosure, and search capabilities.

## Current Information Architecture Analysis

### Existing Structure (12 Sections)
1. **API Configuration** - Core functionality, high frequency
2. **Cost Management** (5 tabs: Budget Config, Alerts, Provider Breakdown, Historical, Reports) - Medium frequency, high importance
3. **Profile Settings** - Low frequency, low importance
4. **Preferences** - Medium frequency, medium importance
5. **Widget Configuration** - Low frequency, medium importance
6. **Layout & Appearance** - Low frequency, medium importance
7. **Performance** - Low frequency, high importance
8. **Security & Privacy** - Low frequency, high importance
9. **Developer Settings** - Low frequency (power users), high importance for developers
10. **Database Settings** - Low frequency, high importance
11. **Notifications** - Medium frequency, medium importance
12. **Integrations** - Low frequency, medium importance

### Major Pain Points Identified

#### 1. Information Architecture Issues
- **Excessive top-level categories**: 12 sections overwhelm choice-making
- **Inconsistent grouping logic**: Related settings scattered across multiple sections
- **Unclear hierarchy**: No visual distinction between basic and advanced settings
- **Tab overload**: Cost Management's 5 tabs create a "menu within a menu" problem

#### 2. Navigation Inefficiencies
- **Decision paralysis**: Too many options at once reduce efficiency
- **Context switching**: Users lose focus switching between numerous sections
- **Cognitive load**: Mental mapping of 12+ sections requires significant effort
- **Mobile usability**: Horizontal scrolling tabs don't work well on smaller screens

#### 3. Findability Problems
- **No search functionality**: Users must visually scan all options
- **Missing progressive disclosure**: All settings visible regardless of user type
- **Lack of contextual access**: No quick-access patterns for related settings

## Recommended New Categorization (5 Main Groups)

### 1. **Essential** (Always Visible)
**Icon**: ⚡ **Color**: Purple (#A100FF)
- API Configuration (moved up for immediate access)
- Profile Settings (basic user info)

### 2. **Operations** (High Frequency)
**Icon**: 💰 **Color**: Green (#00B050)
- Cost Management (consolidated with smart tabs)
- Notifications (operation-related alerts)

### 3. **Customization** (Medium Frequency)
**Icon**: 🎨 **Color**: Blue (#2563EB)
- Preferences (app behavior)
- Widget Configuration
- Layout & Appearance

### 4. **System** (Low Frequency, High Impact)
**Icon**: ⚙️ **Color**: Orange (#FF8C00)
- Performance
- Security & Privacy
- Database Settings

### 5. **Advanced** (Power Users)
**Icon**: 🔧 **Color**: Red (#E74C3C)

## Progressive Disclosure Strategy

### Tier 1: Always Visible (Essential)
```
┌─ Essential Settings
├── API Configuration ⭐ (Required badge)
└── Profile Settings
```

### Tier 2: Contextual Display (Based on Usage)
```
┌─ Operations
├── Cost Management
│   ├── Quick Setup (Budget + Alerts combined)
│   └── Advanced (Provider breakdown, Historical, Reports) [Expandable]
└── Notifications
```

### Tier 3: Advanced Toggle
```
┌─ Show Advanced Settings [Toggle]
├── System
├── Advanced
└── Customization (expanded options)
```

## Search & Command Palette Design

### Quick Search Implementation
```typescript
interface SearchResult {
  title: string;
  path: string;
  category: string;
  keywords: string[];
  importance: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  userType: 'all' | 'admin' | 'developer';
}
```

### Search Features
1. **Fuzzy matching**: "cost" finds "Cost Management", "budget", "alerts"
2. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Ctrl+K / Cmd+K for quick access
3. **Recent items**: Show last 3 accessed settings
4. **Smart suggestions**: Based on user role and usage patterns

### Search UI
- **Floating search bar** at top of settings modal
- **Real-time results** with category grouping
- **Keyboard navigation** with arrow keys and enter
- **Direct action**: Jump to setting or execute simple actions

## Cost Management Optimization

### Current Problems
- 5 separate tabs create navigation overhead
- Related information scattered across multiple views
- No clear priority hierarchy within cost settings

### Proposed Solution: Smart Consolidation

#### Primary View: Cost Dashboard
```
┌─ Cost Overview (Always visible)
├── Current spend vs budget (visual gauge)
├── This month's alerts (if any)
├── Quick budget adjustment
└── Top 3 providers spending
```

#### Secondary Actions: Progressive Disclosure
```
┌─ Quick Actions
├── Set Budget Limit
├── Configure Alerts (simplified)
└── View Detailed Reports [Link to expanded view]

┌─ Advanced Options [Expandable]
├── Provider-specific budgets
├── Historical analysis
├── Custom alert thresholds
├── Automated reports
└── Cost optimization suggestions
```

## Priority Matrix Analysis

### High Frequency + High Importance (Tier 1)

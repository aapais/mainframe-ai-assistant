## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Data Flow
1. **Mock Data Generation:** Realistic data simulation for demonstration
2. **Real-time Updates:** Configurable refresh intervals (default 30s)
3. **State Management:** Local component state with useMemo optimization
4. **Responsive Design:** Grid layouts that adapt to screen sizes

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized calculations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient data filtering and sorting
- Lazy loading of detailed panels
- Optimized chart rendering with ResponsiveContainer

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { SearchAnalyticsDashboard } from '@/components/analytics';

function AnalyticsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      <SearchAnalyticsDashboard
        refreshInterval={30000}
        enableRealTimeUpdates={true}
        onMetricClick={(metric, value) => {
          console.log(`Clicked ${metric}:`, value);
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

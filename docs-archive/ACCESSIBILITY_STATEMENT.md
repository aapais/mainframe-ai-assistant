## KNOWN ACCESSIBILITY BARRIERS

We have identified the following accessibility barriers and are actively working to address them:

### High Priority Issues (Target Resolution: September 30, 2025)

#### 1. Color Contrast Deficiencies
**Issue:** Some text elements do not meet the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio required by WCAG 2.1 AA
**Impact:** Users with visual impairments may have difficulty reading certain text
**Affected Areas:** Secondary text, placeholder text, some button states
**Status:** Fixes in development, testing in progress

#### 2. Missing Skip Navigation Links
**Issue:** No skip links are currently provided to bypass repetitive navigation content
**Impact:** Keyboard and screen reader users must navigate through all navigation elements to reach main content
**Affected Areas:** Main application navigation
**Status:** Implementation in progress, expected completion September 22, 2025

#### 3. Color-Only Information Indicators
**Issue:** Some status information is conveyed through color alone
**Impact:** Users who are colorblind or using high contrast mode may miss important status information
**Affected Areas:** Entry status indicators, form validation states
**Status:** Alternative indicators being added, completion expected September 25, 2025

### Medium Priority Issues (Target Resolution: November 30, 2025)

#### 4. Incomplete Live Region Implementation
**Issue:** Some dynamic content changes are not announced to screen readers
**Impact:** Screen reader users may miss important updates or status changes
**Status:** Systematic review and enhancement in progress

#### 5. Advanced Keyboard Navigation
**Issue:** Some advanced features lack comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
**Impact:** Power users who rely on keyboard navigation may experience reduced efficiency
**Status:** Comprehensive keyboard shortcut system in development

#### 6. Mobile Accessibility Optimization

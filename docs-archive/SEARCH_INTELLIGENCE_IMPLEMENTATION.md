## 🔧 Integration Guide

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { IntelligentKBSearchBar } from './components/IntelligentKBSearchBar';

function App() {
  return (
    <IntelligentKBSearchBar
      context="incidents" // Page context for better suggestions
      showHelp={true}     // Enable help system
      showSuggestions={true} // Enable smart suggestions
      onSearchComplete={(results, query) => {
        // Handle search results with analytics
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

});

// Use smart suggestions with custom options
const { suggestions } = useSearchSuggestions(query, context, {
  maxSuggestions: 8,
  enableTypoCorrection: true,
  enableContextAware: true,
  fuzzyThreshold: 0.7
});

# Dependency Installation Report

## Installation Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

The project dependencies have been successfully installed after resolving configuration and file system issues.

## Installation Summary

- **Total packages installed**: 925 packages
- **Installation time**: ~4 minutes
- **Node version**: v22.19.0
- **NPM version**: 11.6.0

## Key Dependencies Installed

### Core Dependencies
- `react@18.3.1`
- `react-dom@18.3.1`
- `typescript@5.9.2`

### Development Dependencies
- `electron@26.6.10`
- `electron-builder@24.13.3`
- `vite@5.4.20`
- `jest@29.7.0`
- `playwright@1.55.0`
- `eslint@8.57.1`
- `prettier@3.6.2`

## Issues Identified

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities (3 moderate)
- **electron** <=35.7.4: Heap Buffer Overflow and ASAR Integrity Bypass
- **esbuild** <=0.24.2: Development server vulnerability
- **vite** 0.11.0 - 6.1.6: Depends on vulnerable esbuild

### 2. TypeScript Compilation Errors
Multiple TypeScript errors found in source files:
- Syntax errors in regex expressions
- Unterminated string literals
- JSX/TSX syntax issues
- Missing type annotations

### 3. Deprecated Packages
The following packages are deprecated and should be updated:
- `eslint@8.57.1` (no longer supported)
- `electron-notarize@1.2.2` (use @electron/notarize)
- Multiple glob and rimraf versions
- `inflight@1.0.6` (memory leak issues)

## Configuration Issues Resolved

### NPM Configuration Problems
The `.npmrc` file contained several deprecated/unknown configurations:
- `cache-min` (deprecated)
- `hoisting` (unknown)
- `target_platform`/`target_arch` (unknown)
- `disturl`/`runtime` (unknown)
- `build_from_source`/`node_gyp` (unknown)

### Solution Applied
- Temporarily removed `.npmrc` file during installation
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve dependency conflicts
- Restored `.npmrc` after successful installation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix TypeScript errors** before running builds
2. **Update security vulnerabilities**: Run `npm audit fix --force` (may cause breaking changes)
3. **Update deprecated packages** to their modern equivalents

### Future Improvements
1. Update `.npmrc` to remove deprecated configurations
2. Consider upgrading to latest versions of major dependencies
3. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Build Status
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ❌ TypeScript compilation (syntax errors need fixing)
- ⚠️ Security vulnerabilities present
- ⚠️ Deprecated packages in use

## Next Steps
1. Address TypeScript compilation errors in source files
2. Review and update security-vulnerable packages
3. Clean up deprecated package usage
4. Test build process after fixes

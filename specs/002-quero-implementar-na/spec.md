# Feature Specification: RAG LLM Chatbot for Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `002-quero-implementar-na`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "Quero implementar na secção de documentação uma feature 'chatbot' usando um RAG LLM com a tabela de Knowledge base da base de dados PostgresSQL. O chatbot deve manter contexto de conversação até ao limite do LLM parametrizado. Na janela de chat deve ser possivel escolher entre os modelos LLM com chaves API parametrizadas para o utilizador e que estejam ativas na tabela API_Keys. Dependendo do LLM escolhido devem ser usados os embbedings existentes para esse LLM na tabela Knowledge base"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a mainframe operations team member working in the documentation section, I want to interact with an intelligent chatbot that can answer questions about our knowledge base using AI, maintaining conversation context throughout our dialogue, so that I can quickly find relevant information and solutions without manually searching through documents.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is in the documentation section with configured API keys, **When** they open the chatbot interface, **Then** they see a model selector dropdown showing only LLM models with active API keys configured for their account.

2. **Given** a user has selected an LLM model and types a question, **When** they submit the query, **Then** the system searches the Knowledge base using the corresponding embeddings for that LLM and returns a relevant response based on RAG retrieval.

3. **Given** an ongoing conversation with multiple exchanges, **When** the user asks a follow-up question referencing previous context, **Then** the chatbot maintains conversation history and provides contextually aware responses up to the model's token limit.

4. **Given** a user switches between different LLM models during usage, **When** they select a new model, **Then** the system switches to use the appropriate embeddings for that model from the Knowledge base table.

5. **Given** a user's API key becomes inactive or invalid, **When** they try to use that model, **Then** the system removes it from available options and prompts to select another active model.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the selected LLM's token limit is reached during a conversation?
- How does system handle when no embeddings exist for a selected LLM in the Knowledge base?
- What occurs if all API keys become inactive during a conversation?
- How does the system respond when the Knowledge base has no relevant content for a query?
- What happens if the PostgreSQL connection fails during a chat session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a chatbot interface accessible from the documentation section
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve and display only LLM models that have active API keys in the API_Keys table for the current user
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Knowledge base table from PostgreSQL
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain conversation context between messages up to the configured token limit of the selected LLM
- **FR-005**: System MUST use model-specific embeddings from the Knowledge base table corresponding to the selected LLM
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to switch between different LLM models during a session
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate API key status before each model interaction
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear feedback when no relevant knowledge base content is found
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist conversation history across user sessions for continuity
- **FR-010**: System MUST warn users when approaching the token limit of the selected LLM model
- **FR-011**: System MUST display a maximum of 5 previous messages in the chat history view
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide a single chat window interface (no concurrent conversations)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Conversation**: Represents a dialogue session between user and chatbot, maintaining message history and selected model
- **Chat Message**: Individual message in a conversation, including user queries and AI responses with timestamps
- **Model Configuration**: Active LLM model selection linked to user's API keys and corresponding embeddings
- **Knowledge Context**: Retrieved knowledge base entries used for RAG responses, linked to specific embeddings
